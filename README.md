# **Social-Media**

* * *

The alpha stages have been released! You could download it [here](https://github.com/root3287/Social-Media/archive/master.zip). The current program is now released as a somewhat stable build, and comes with an alpha tag. So far we are currentally trying to add features and killing bugs.

## **What is Social-Media?**

This is a open source social-media. This means this code is free to be view along on the site. We also belive that other sites, such as Youtube and Facebook, have a poor copyright system. The main project site could be found [here](https://social-media.root3287.site).
